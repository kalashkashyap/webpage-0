                <h2>MISSILE MAN OF INDIA</h2>
                <p>
                    <b>Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam </b>is celebrated as the Father of Indian Missile Technology because of his pivotal role in advancing India's defense capabilities. He was the chief architect of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP), a landmark initiative aimed at achieving self-reliance in missile technology.
                    Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam is known as the Father of Indian Missile Technology because of his significant contributions that led India to achieve self-reliance in missile technology.
                    As the chief architect of the Integrated Guided Missile Development Program (IGMDP), Dr. Kalam led the development of strategic missiles like Agni and Prithvi which put Pakistan and China under India’s missile range. These projects significantly enhanced India's defense capabilities. 
                    Dr. Kalam’s leadership also played a pivotal role in the successful Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, establishing India as a nuclear-armed state. 
                    Apart from being renowned as the Missile Man of India, Dr. Kalam was a visionary whose contributions were not limited to space research, innovation and technology. He was a mentor who advocated for and nurtured the youth to develop scientific temperaments.
